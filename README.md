# üß¨ Polymer Simulation: PE and PS Chains

This project simulates the behavior of **polyethylene (PE)** and **polystyrene (PS)** polymer chains using molecular dynamics (MD). It includes interactions like **Lennard-Jones forces**, **bond stretching**, and **angle bending**, with **periodic boundary conditions** and velocity rescaling to maintain temperature.

## üì¶ Features

- 3D molecular dynamics simulation
- Supports multiple polymer types (e.g., PE and PS)
- Lennard-Jones + bond + angle forces
- Temperature control via velocity rescaling
- Radius of gyration & MSD tracking
- LAMMPS-style dump output

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: This simulation was developed primarily for educational purposes and conceptual understanding. For high-accuracy and large-scale molecular dynamics, established tools like **LAMMPS** or **GROMACS** are significantly more robust and effective.*
