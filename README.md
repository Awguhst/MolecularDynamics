# 🧬 Polymer Simulation: PE and PS Chains

This project simulates the behavior of **polyethylene (PE)** and **polystyrene (PS)** polymer chains using molecular dynamics (MD). It includes interactions like **Lennard-Jones forces**, **bond stretching**, and **angle bending**, with **periodic boundary conditions** and velocity rescaling to maintain temperature.
